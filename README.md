### Hey there 👋 _Aditya_ this side,


* :telescope: I'm a Graduate Student in Aeronautics _&_ Astronautics, setting-up and building (code) packages (solvers) to solve complex scientific problems in my main arsenal of High Speed Combustion, Chemical Kinetics of Turbulent Flames, Acoustic Instabilities, Usage of ML and Statistics in analyzing thermochemical datasets and a lot of debugging using HPC in Combustion-based Open Source Packages.
* :runner: I do compound movements and shuttling 🏸 to stay in shape :muscle:

### Tech Stack 💻

##  Programming Languages 🎨

* Core: _Python_, _C & C++_, _Julia_, _Fortran_, _MATLAB_ and _Java_ (Pipeline)

## ML Tools 📝

* Neural Operators (FNO & DeepONet)
* Differentiable Programming (JAX Equinox)

## Surrogate Modelling _&_ ROM-Tools 🛠️

* Reduced-Order-models: PyMOR & MFEM (libROM)
* Surrogate & Emulation Libraries: learning both GPyTorch (cornelius) _&_ GPFlow (Seems GPFlow tends to glide past its predescessor!) and XGBoost for closure regression and regime maps.
* Manifold Learning: UMAP

## Uncertainty Quantification 📈

* UQ: UQpy _&_ OpenTURNS for probabilistic analysis of large scale flamelet models

## Spray Dynamics (Learning; required for regime identification and closure learning of large datasets) 💨

* Particle Datasets: HDF5 (H5Py)
* Segmentation Tools: Scikit (Hierarchial based DBScan)
* Model Sequencing: PyTorch Forecasting using Temporal Convolution

## Data-Analysis 🖥️

* Graphing: TecPlot, OriginPro, Paraview _&_ MatPlotLib
* Parallel Processing: OpenMPI, Dask, XArray, similarly I use VTK and MeshIO for visualization and mesh conversions 

### CFD Packages 🚀
* Open-sources: OpenFoam & Cantera
* Commercials: ANSYS (WorkBench, Fluent _&_ Chemkin), GridPro, StarCCM+, Converge
