### Hey there 👋 _Aditya_ this side,


* :telescope: I am a **Graduate Student in Aeronautics and Astronautics** with a strong research focus on **computational combustion, high-speed reacting flows, and data-driven modeling of complex thermochemical systems**. My work lies at the intersection of **physics-based solvers, chemical kinetics, turbulence–chemistry interaction, and scientific machine learning**, with extensive use of **HPC environments and open-source combustion frameworks**.
* :runner: I do compound movements and shuttling 🏸 to stay in shape :muscle:
