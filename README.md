:telescope: I am a **Graduate Student in Aeronautics and Astronautics** with a strong research focus on **computational combustion, high-speed reacting flows, and data-driven modeling of complex thermochemical systems**. My work lies at the intersection of **physics-based solvers, chemical kinetics, turbulence–chemistry interaction, and scientific machine learning**, with extensive use of **HPC environments and open-source combustion frameworks**.

:runner: I do compound movements and shuttling 🏸 to stay in shape :muscle:

My long-term goal is to develop **robust, scalable, and physically interpretable reduced-order and surrogate models** for reacting flow simulations, enabling faster design cycles and improved predictive fidelity for aerospace and energy applications.
