# Hey Everyone, This is Aditya Iyer Ramesh 👋🏼 

I know that sounds like a pretty strechy name, but yeah you can call me **"Aditya"**.

Before you know more about me, If you're a coffeeholic, then welcome to my club of "coffeestreakers"! I love'em.

These are some of my _foibles_ A.k.a. (**purest coincidences**) y'all would like to know of me, but yeah it's blatant enough to portray my existence in this quirky forum, If not so for some code :) 

I'm an Undergrad (**Class of 2020**) who did the _Three Indian Mistakes_ 😅;

 😁 Did dencently good at studies (Not great thou)! 

 😁 Did decent math, apart from regression, calculus and combinatorics everything scattered my attention, and somehow I found a path to converge it into _Physics_ and _Chemistry_ 😅 ("**Bonds**", yeah that's what I'm talkin' about)! 

 😁 After giving the most coveted **AISSCE**, I too opted for doing the _"Jugaad"_ (_translation: figuring out something out of nothing_) with machines, but this time there was a process involved, so yeah basically "**Chemical Engineering**" was what I worked my ass of for a quarter of a decade !! 

After perceiving such blunders, I thought of deviating my attention onto something which involved programming and computations, that's where I learned about CFD which can be simulated through many coding languesges let alone MATLAB, Python, Julia, Cantera and so on. Now, I deal with them so often, that I slip to check on my friends. 

Talking about my LTCG (_abbr_: **Long-term-Career-Goals**) I like to explore fields pertinent to: 

  💡 CFD (Large Eddy Simulations and Direct Numerical Simulations). 

  💡 Chemically Reacting Flows and Reacting Gas Dynamics. 

  💡 Compressible and Incompressible Flows, Subsonic and Supersonic Noise Simulations (A Retrospective Analysis). 

  💡 Simulating Nanofluids which potentially diverges the area of Computational Nanotechnology. 

So that pursuit persuaded me to think of applying for Doctoral Studies this upcoming Fall (That's for 2022) in the field of **Chemical Engineering** specialising in **Computational Sciences**. I'll keep updating this "readme" as and when I broaden my horizon and transcend my expertise in the said fields.

**A Quick Update**: An separate _site hosting_ is in the pipeline. I'll paste the URL here, as soon as I conclude that.
